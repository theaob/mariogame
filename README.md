##Mario Game
This project follows game engine tutorial from GamesWithGame located at https://www.youtube.com/c/GamesWithGabe/videos 

jbox2d dependency is not great with maven, so I added jar and a maven install script for easy integration. 
jbox2d project is not up-to-date on maven central.

There are various naming and pattern differences from the tutorial. The engine will be renamed and refactored after I finish the tutorial.
